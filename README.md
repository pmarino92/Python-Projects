 These are my Python projects that I have been working on. They use various modules such as tkinter or sqlite3

## Phonebook
This project functions as a phone book for a user. It is able to save a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries

## Check Files Gui
Allows the user to choose to transfer all .txt files from one chose directory to another. All files are moved and will be saved in a database.

## Space Invaders
Created the classic arcade shooter Space Invaders using Python and Pygame. Through the use of classes, I was able to create a player/enemy ship as well as a laser class. More so I was able to create a functioning laser collision system just like the game. Finally, I was able to code in a UI health bar underneath the player ship that would go down when hit by a laser or an enemy ship.

Here is a quick screenshot:
